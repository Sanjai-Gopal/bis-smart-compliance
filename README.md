# 🏛️ BIS Smart Product Compliance System

## 📘 Overview

The **BIS Smart Product Compliance System** is a web-based application that analyzes product descriptions and verifies whether the claims made (such as *shockproof*, *waterproof*, *energy efficient*, etc.) comply with **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** regulations.

The system uses **Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically extract product claims and map them against predefined BIS standards. It provides compliance status, risk analysis, and consumer-support features through a simple and attractive interface.

This project is developed as part of an **AI & Data Science academic project** and deployed as a **public web application**.

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. User enters a product description
2. NLP extracts relevant product claims
3. Claims are matched with BIS standards
4. Compliance status and explanations are generated
5. A compliance score and risk level are displayed
6. Users can submit complaints or explore awareness content

## 📢 Complaint Centre

The Complaint Centre allows consumers to report:
- Misleading product claims
- Safety concerns
- Fake BIS certification
- Poor product quality

This module demonstrates how AI systems can support regulatory authorities and consumer protection initiatives.
